## **Predictive Model: Building a Data-Driven Tool for Predicting Donor Behavior**

Charities need donors, but finding them can be tricky. That's where I used machine learning to build a tool that predicts potential donors!
Here's the simplified approach:


~Examined the data: Performed EDA, I explored the information to understand who donates and why.

~Prepared the data: I cleaned and organized the data, making it easier for the computer to learn from.

~Encoded the categorical features: I turned the categories into codes the computer understands.

~Built a smart model: I used a decision tree to predict who might donate.

~Made it even better: I fine-tuned the model to be as accurate as possible.



The result? A tool that can help charities target their outreach efforts and connect with the right people. By using data and technology, we can make a bigger impact for those in need!
